# odin-recipes
This is a basic website made to practice my HTML learnings so far. It will contain links to a few recipes.
Recipes contained are:

-Deviled Eggs

-Onigiri (tuna mayo)

-Cinnamon Toast **this one is kind of snarky because... it's just buttered toast with cinnamon and sugar on it.**

Tried my best with the attributions. Unsure if there are better/more standardized ways to do these.
