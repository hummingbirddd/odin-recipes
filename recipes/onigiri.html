       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>A handheld snack, perfect on the go and easy to prepare ahead of time.</p>
       <p>Onigiri is a triangle of sticky rice filled with anything from tuna, to eggs, to pickled plums. It's typically wrapped in seaweed.</p>       
       <p>The recipe below will outline the basics of making tuna mayo onigiri, but you can try it with other fillings.</p>
       <h3>Tools (and their substitutions)</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>rice cooker (sub - pot)</li>
        <li>onigiri mold (sub - small bowl with plastic wrap)</li>
        <li>small bowl of water</li>
        <li>small rice paddle (sub - spoon)</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked short-grain Japanese rice</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 package nori sheets</li>
        <li>1 5oz can tuna in oil, drained</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Prepare and cook the rice. Be sure to wash and soak the rice to ensure proper stickiness prior to cooking. Let cool in a bowl until it can be handled comfortably.</li>        
        <li>In a small bowl, combine tuna, kewpie mayonnaise, and soy sauce. This will be the filling.</li>
        <li>Rub hands with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Dip fingertips in water throughout process. This will help to keep rice from sticking.</li>
        <li>Fill the bottom onigiri mold about halfway with rice.</li>
        <li>Make a small indent in the middle of the rice. Add a dollop of filling mixture.</li>
        <li>Fill the rest of the mold to the top with rice.</li>
        <li>Cover with the onigiri mold lid and press into shape.</li>
        <li>Release rice triangle from the mold and set aside. Repeat with remaining rice.</li>
        <li>Wrap rice ball in as much nori as preferred. Often this is a rectangular strip, or enough to cover the whole onigiri.</li>
        <li>(optional) Top onigiri with a small dollop of filling. This helps to identify what kind of filling it is.</li>
       </ol>  
       <h3>Steps with Small Bowl</h3>
       <p>If you don't have an onigiri mold, you can make the rice balls this way instead!</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Place a piece of plastic wrap in the small bowl and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Add a 1/4-1/3c rice to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a small indent and add filling.</li>
        <li>Add an equal amount of rice on top to cover the filling. Sprinkle again with salt.</li>
        <li>Gather the plastic wrap together and wrap/twist tightly around the rice to form the ball. Release from plastic.</li>
        <li>Press the rice ball into shape with your hands.</li>
        <li>Follow same steps as above to wrap and top the rice ball.</li>
       </ol>
